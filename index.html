            <h1>History of the Android Mascot</h1>
            <p>You probably know that the <a href="" class="link">Android</a> operating system, maintained by <a href="" class="link">Google</a>, is one of the most widely used mobile platforms worldwide. But you might not know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very interesting history. Follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The First Version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a href="" class="link out">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="" class="link out">Inkscape</a> (a free software for vector image editing) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system for his team; there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <a href="" class="link">Dandroids</a>.</p>

            <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot kept developing, and the task was assigned to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="" class="link out">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few lines and in a flat style. The design should also create quick identification for those who look at it. Thus, the <a href="" class="link">Bugdroid</a>, the new Android mascot, was born.</p>

            <img id="bugdroid" src="images/bugdroid.png" alt="">
            <p>The main inspiration for the lines of the new Bugdroid came from those little figures that illustrate restroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk in Google's office and looked to the restroom doors on the side, and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, straightforward.</p>

                <p>Another curious aspect about Android is that each version has always been named after a dessert, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lollipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Unfortunately, there was no Android Q, as Google decided to end this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>
